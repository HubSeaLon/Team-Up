# Team-Up

## Conception of a mobile application

When you’re a high school student, life feels comfortable. You have your friends, your hobbies, and everything seems easy. But when it’s time to leave for university or work in a new city, everything changes.
We know this because we’ve all been there. The three of us moved to new cities for our studies, and we all faced the same challenge: making new friends and finding people to share activities with.
That’s why we created TeamUp.

It is a Social Networking app designed to connect people with similar interests and passions. Imagine you’re missing one person to play a 5v5 football match, or you want to find someone to join your gaming session. With our app, you can post about your activity, and others nearby can join you.

It’s not just about sports or video games—it’s about building connections, creating communities, and making sure no one feels alone in a new city.

We know how important it is to feel connected, especially in a world where it’s easy to feel isolated. That’s why TeamUp isn’t just a basic app, it’s a tool to help you build real-life connections.
